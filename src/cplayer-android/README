Android C trace player
======================

This application plays back trace files that have been converted to C code
using the analyzer.

Usage:

1. Load the trace file to the analyzer and export it as C code:

    $ cd src/analyzer
    $ python TracyAnalyzer.py
    >>> load trace.bin
    >>> export t0 trace.inl c

2. Copy the generated file (trace.inl) to this directory.

3. Replace "triangle.inl" in jni/Android.mk with the correct trace file name.

4. Build and install:

    $ ndk-build
    $ ant debug
    $ adb install -r bin/cplayer-debug.apk
